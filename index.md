# Introduction to Deep Learning


## Installation

All course materials can be followed using the Google Colab or Binder links below.

For a local installation of the materials, please install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install). The slide format of the Jupyter notebooks is provided by the [`RISE`](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) plugin.
This class is based on `torch` and `torchvision`; please refer to the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) website for installation instructions. We'll also be using the packages `sklearn`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
