# Introduction to Deep Learning

This is a short introduction to deep learning intended for those with no or little deep learning experience. Using Numpy and Pytorch, we cover the fundamental bases of deep learning: neural networks, backpropagation, and gradient descent. We also show practical examples of feedforward and convolutional neural networks on the Fashion MNIST problem.

This class is a part of the [Reinforcement Learning Virtual School](https://rl-vs.github.io/rlvs2021/index.html).

## Installation

All course materials can be followed on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/d9w/deep-learning-intro/HEAD) or through the Google Colab links below.

For a local installation of the materials, please install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install). The slide format of the Jupyter notebooks is provided by the [`RISE`](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) plugin.
This class is based on `torch` and `torchvision`; please refer to the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) website for installation instructions. We'll also be using the packages `sklearn`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Class Materials

All class materials can be downloaded from the [Github repository](https://github.com/d9w/deep-learning-intro/).

We'll be conducting a live poll throughout the class at the following link: [https://ahaslides.com/DEEP-INTRO](https://ahaslides.com/DEEP-INTRO). The poll questions and responses can be viewed [here](https://presenter.ahaslides.com/share/1616536096200-2zkjoc6b4c?presenting=true).

## Additional Materials

This class is largely based on the [Supaero Data
Science](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/) [Deep Learning
class](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/deep-learning/).

[The deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is fully available
online and contains many great examples. Notebook versions of those examples are
available [here](https://github.com/hadrienj/deepLearningBook-Notes).

[The Neural Networks and Deep Learning online
book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) covers the universal
approximation theorem with a nice interactive visualization.

PyTorch has a well-documented [60 minute
blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
intended for beginners with PyTorch.

Stanford CS229 Lectures are [freely available
online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfIjxPh6Pys). Lectures 11 and 12
introduce ANNs, backpropagation, and gradient descent, with lecture 12 going
further in depth on how to resolve common training problems in ANNs.
